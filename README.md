# NBA Rookie All-Star Potential Prediction

### What does this do
- This project applies a K-Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm to predict whether each and every NBA rookie from the 2023-2024 season have the potential to be selected at "All-Star" based on their rookie statistics. 
- The analysis is performed by comparing these rookies to past players drafted between 1979 and 2020, including many all-time greats
- Selected key performance metrics (points, assists, and rebounds) as predictors

### Techniques involved:
- Conducting Research on Quality Data
- Data Import and Wrangling
- KNN Classfication
- Exploratory Analysis
- Model Evaluation
- Performance Analysis
